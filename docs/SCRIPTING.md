# M40 JavaScript gameplay

Current public JavaScript signatures, examples and lifetime rules: [JudasJS reference](JUDASJS.md). This document retains milestone architecture and evidence context.

Judas embeds **QuickJS-NG v0.17.0** (MIT). Core sources and the complete
license are under `third_party/quickjs`; runtime exports include its credits
and license in `engine/third_party/RUNTIME_NOTICES.txt` through the existing
exporter. No Node, browser, CLI or QuickJS libc/OS modules are shipped.

## Authoring

Import/track `.js` in the project's Asset Browser. Add **Scripts** to an entity,
select an asset, then edit the declared boolean/number/string fields. Add more
behaviours for ordered slots; persistent slot IDs are separate from slot order.
Prefab source/instance edits use normal component serialization and overrides.
Properties may store asset IDs as strings. Editing a property does not rewrite JS.
Restart Play after changing code; no live state migration is provided.

```js
import {input, world, console} from 'judas';
export const properties = {speed: {type: 'number', default: 2}};
export default class Behaviour {
  constructor({entity, properties}) {
    this.entity = entity;
    this.properties = properties;
    this.state = {count: 0};
  }
  start() {}                      // after saved state is restored
  update(dt) {}                   // once per active outer gameplay frame
  fixedUpdate(dt) {               // before ordinary fixed-step forces/physics
    if (input.pressed('interact')) this.state.count++;
  }
  destroy() {}
}
```

`start/update/fixedUpdate/destroy` are optional, synchronous callbacks. A default
exported class gets one independent instance per slot. Constructors initialize
instances; put gameplay in callbacks. Relative imports must resolve to registered
project `.js` assets. Bare imports other than `judas` and native/absolute imports
are rejected. ES module globals are shared by that Play session, intentionally;
`this.state` and constructor properties are per instance. No per-frame compilation.
Asynchronous callbacks/top-level await are unsupported; no promise scheduler.

One engine-owned `ScriptSystem` lives in each played `RuntimeWorld`. Calls run on
the runtime/main thread, outside renderer/physics ownership. Both standalone and
editor Play call the same `GameSession` frame and `StepPlayedWorld` fixed boundaries.
Menus pause gameplay callbacks; M41 uiUpdate/onUI remain active for UI. Fixed input uses M35's latched snapshot, including short
presses across zero-step frames, without consuming another system's snapshot.
Entities run by stable ID, then authored slot order. Spawns join at the next
callback boundary; destruction invalidates handles immediately. Stop destroys
instances/context before world resources. No scripting VM is created for worlds
without script slots.

The inspector evaluates module metadata in a **no-world context**, with no
constructors or gameplay callbacks. Top-level module code must be declarative;
world calls there fail. Metadata is cached until its selected source file changes.
Imported metadata helper edits require reselect/reopen/restart (no live reload).

## Public API

`docs/judas.d.ts` describes the small `judas` module. Vectors/quaternions are plain
objects; entity IDs are **decimal strings** (runtime IDs exceed JS safe integers).
Wrappers resolve ID against their own live world on every call. They retain no
body pointer or native lifetime; physics calls reacquire generation-checked handles.

- `entity`, `world.entity`, `world.queryTags`, `world.spawnPrefab`, `world.overlap`,
  `world.sweepCapsule` (existing player-shape capsule, **not arbitrary capsules**).
- Entity transform, parent/children, destroy hierarchy, tags/classification,
  controlled state snapshot by slot, force/impulse/torque and velocities.
- Named input held/pressed/released/axis; time delta, fixed flag, authoritative
  fixed simulation elapsed time. No physical SDL keys or wall clock.
- Authored audio play/stop/pause/resume/enable and status; particles burst/enable/rate;
  existing render-target camera inspection/enable. M49 additionally exposes world.setView/clearView for independent script-owned main-view intent;
  see the current camera reference.
- Query include/exclude layer names, required/excluded tags and ignored entities.
  Overlaps are **conservative broadphase candidates**, not exact intersections.

Transform writes use ordinary authoritative bodies/runtime components; body pose
writes are **teleports**, not continuous kinematic trajectories. Scale is visual,
consistent with Judas's explicit collision geometry. Force APIs require an active
dynamic body. Existing runtime-spawn component limits remain unchanged.

## Persistence and failures

`this.state` supports bounded plain JSON: null, booleans, finite numbers, strings,
arrays and objects. Maximum depth 16, 4096 visited values and 64 KiB serialized per
slot (4096 saved slots per world); no cycles/accessors/functions/custom prototypes. Invalid state rejects saving
rather than dropping it or serializing the VM. Authored properties are separate.

M29 version 2 gains an **optional `script-state-schema 1` extension**, with records
keyed by stable entity/slot. Script-free saves/scene fingerprints are unchanged;
old readers reject the unknown extension. Complete state/reference validation
precedes mutation. Runtime-created prefab definitions restore through ordinary
M29 creation, and saved state is installed before `start`/update resumes. No VM heap,
closures, modules, bytecode or promise state is persisted. Save does not restore
one-shot audio, callbacks' transient private members, runtime tags or the global
runtime clock. Reapply state-driven transient effects in `start` when needed.

Authored schema-5 fingerprints gain tagged `Judas.ScriptComponents.1` data.
Scripted worlds additionally hash **all registered project JS IDs and source
contents** (`Judas.ScriptSources.1`): deliberately strict compatibility also covers
runtime-only prefab behaviours. Paths/timestamps/pointers never enter that digest.
Any registered code change/addition/removal rejects existing scripted-world saves.
Missing/broken scripts fault their own instances; export rejects broken required
module/import closures. Script-free worlds retain their old compatibility.

The first module/construction/callback failure logs asset/entity/slot/context and
runtime message/stack, then disables only that instance until Play restarts. Other
instances continue. An interrupt guard defaults to 10,000 VM polling callbacks per
invocation (`ScriptSystem::SetBudget`), with 64 MiB VM memory and 512 KiB stack limits.
This is trusted project code with limited engine capabilities, **not a malicious
security sandbox or hard realtime guarantee**. Native allocations and indivisible
native calls are not time-sliced.

## Demo / operator check

Open `projects/script_demo/script_demo.judasproj` and Play:

1. G reports a locked door; K collects the yellow key; G now opens/closes blue door.
2. P spawns green scripted prefab hierarchies; J applies impulses to them independently.
3. Hear the effects and see bursts; normal keyboard/mouse movement still works.
4. F6 saves; restart/reload retains key, door and spawned instance states. F7 deletes
   that save explicitly when starting fresh. Do not edit the baseline to test loading.
5. Stop restores authored editor content; export/move/run the same project normally.

All key/lock/spawner rules live in JS. C++ supplies only engine primitives.
Human visual/listening acceptance remains the operator's responsibility.

## M44 explicit geometry queries

Import `physics` for `raycast`, `sphereCast`, `capsuleCast` and `boxCast`.
They return a nearest-hit snapshot with a normal safe entity wrapper, or `null`.
They share M39 query filtering and never drive collision response/events.
See [PHYSICS_QUERIES.md](PHYSICS_QUERIES.md) for signatures, conventions and
terrain limitations; typed declarations are in `judas.d.ts`.

M45 adds `physics.joint(ownerEntity)` and safe `Joint` controls for enabling, limits, bounded motors and spring/damping. See [JOINTS.md](JOINTS.md) and the `Joint` declaration in `judas.d.ts`. These expose physical relationships; project JavaScript supplies their meaning.
